# Regression-with-feature-engineering
- House price prediction using the California Housing prices dataset
- Tried Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, KNN and Random Forest Model
- Feature engineered two extra features
- Current best model is Random Forest. With hyperparameter tuning, achieved a R-squared(R2) of	0.822, and Root mean squared error of 48959.675

# To-do:
- Try support vector regressor
- Try removing outliers to see if that improves the performance
- Better documentation
